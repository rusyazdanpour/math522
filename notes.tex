\section{Real numbers}

\begin{defn}
  The \emph{real number system} is a complete ordered field. That is, it is a set $\RR$ together with distinguished elements $0,1$, operations $+,\times$ and an ordering $<$ satisfying the following rules.
\begin{itemize}
\item It is a \emph{field}: it satsfies the associative, commutative, and distributive laws, $0$ is the additive identity and $1$ is the multiplicative identity;
\item It is an \emph{ordered} field: $<$ is a strict total order, $a<b$ implies $a+c<b+c$, and if $c$ is positive then $a<b$ implies $ac<bc$;
\item It is \emph{complete}: if $A\subset\RR$ has an upper bound, then it has a least upper bound (supremum).
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
  It is not difficult to prove that any two complete ordered fields are isomorphic to each other, so it makes sense to define the real number system as the unique such object.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
  The above definition of the real number system is an abstract, axiomatic definition. That is, it doesn't tell you how real numbers behave, but it leaves it up to your imagination what real numbers really are. In fact, we have some choice about this. For example we can view the real numbers as decimal strings or binary strings. For our set-theoretic purposes, all that matters is that we give one construction of the real numbers that works.
\end{rem}

The first to give an explicit and rigorous construction of the real number system was Dedekind, who did so in the 19th century. Here is how his construction worked. First we will take the construction of the rational number system for granted. It is simply the set of fractions whose numerator is an integer and whose denominator is a nonzero natural number.

The key insight is to realize that each real number $r$ has a \emph{cut} in the rational numbers associated with it: the set of rational numbers that are strictly less than $r$. This association should be bijective: If the least upper bound property is true, then any such cut gives rise to a real number as the supremum of the cut. And if two real numbers are different, then they should give rise to different cuts.

So all we have to do to define real numbers was to define cuts. To avoid circularity, we should axiomatize cuts without referring to real numbers at all. A \emph{cut} in the rational numbers is a subset $r\subset\QQ$ satisfying three properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item nontriviality: $r\neq\emptyset$ and $r\neq\QQ$
\item downward closure: if $q\in r$ and $q'<q$ then $q'\in r$
\item no last element: if $q\in r$ then there is $q'>q$ such that $q'\in r$
\end{itemize}
To complete the construction one must say how the $+,\times$ operations and $<$ relation can be defined just in terms of cuts, and then prove that they satisfy the axioms of a complete ordered field. For example, one defines $r+r'$ to be the supremum of the set $\set{q+q'\mid q\in r,q'\in r'}$, and one defines $r<r'$ if and only if $r\subset r'$ and $r\neq r'$. We omit the details of verifying that these definitions work.

\begin{rem}
  It is interesting to compare Dedekind's construction with the modern decimal number construction (which we omit). The decimal number construction is practical for calculations, but has some oddities. For example some numbers have two decimal representations, like $.999\cdots$ and $1$. Also we made an arbitrary decision to use decimal expansions as opposed to any other base. Dedekind's construction is beautiful because it is completely uniform and does not involve any arbitrary decisions.
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
  A set $A$ of real numbers is said to be \emph{countable} if its elements can be enumerated using natural number indices. In other words, $A$ is countable if there exists a sequence $(a_n)_{n\in\NN}$ such that $A=\set{a_n\mid n\in\NN}$.
\end{defn}

Note that this definition implies that finite sets are countable. If we wish to emphasize that a particular countable set is infinite, we will use the term \emph{countably infinite}. A set that is not countable is called \emph{uncountable}. We now give Cantor's famous proof of the fact that the set of all real numbers is uncountable. The argument goes by contradiction and uses a recursive construction to reach a contradiction one step at a time. Such arguments are often called ``diagonal'', for reasons we shall see later on.

\begin{thm}[Cantor]
  The set of all real numbers is uncountable.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose towards a contradiction that the set of all real numbers is countable. Then there exists a sequence $(a_n)_{n\in\NN}$ such that $\RR=\set{a_n\mid n\in\NN}$. Our strategy will be to inductively construct a decreasing sequence of closed intervals $I_n=[l_n,r_r]$ such that for all $n$, $a_n\notin I_n$. Then if $r$ lies in the intersection of these intervals, $r$ cannot be equal to $a_n$ for any $n$, a contradiction.

The construction itself is straightforward. For the base case let $I_1=[l_1,r_1]$ be any interval which omits $a_1$. For the inductive step, if $I_{n-1}$ has been defined, let $I_n=[l_n,r_n]$ be any subinterval of $I_{n-1}$ which omits $a_n$.

We can now find a point in the intersection of the $I_n$ using the completeness property. First observe that since $I_n\subset I_{n-1}$ for all $n$, the set of left endpoints $\set{l_n\mid n\in\NN}$ is bounded above by any and all of the right endpoints $r_n$. By the completeness property, the set of left endpoints has a least upper bound $x$. Since $x$ is an upper bound for $\set{l_n\mid n\in\NN}$, we have $l_n\leq x$ for all $n$. Since $x$ is the least possible upper bound for $\set{l_n\mid n\in\NN}$, we have $x\leq r_n$ for all $n$. Therefore we have $x\in[l_n,r_n]=I_n$ for all $n$.

Since $x$ lies in $I_n$ for all $n$, and since we chose $I_n$ in such a way that it omits $a_n$, we know that $x\neq a_n$ for all $n$. This contradicts the hypothesis that $\RR=\set{a_n\mid n\in\NN}$, and concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

This argument appears in one form or another numerous times throughout elementary analysis and set theory. We shall next see it in the proof of the Baire category theorem.

\section{Baire category theory}

\begin{defn}
  A set of real numbers $A$ is said to be \emph{nowhere dense} if every open interval $I$ contains an open interval $J$ such that $J\cap A=\emptyset$. (Here and always, we implicitly mean that $I$ and $J$ are nonempty.)
\end{defn}

\begin{example}
  Any finite subset of $\RR$ is nowhere dense. The set $\set{1/n\mid n\in\NN}$ is nowhere dense. In fact, any \emph{discrete} set is nowhere dense (here, $A$ is discrete if every point of $A$ is isolated). The set of rational numbers whose numerator is $1$ and whose denominator is a power of $2$ is \emph{not} nowhere dense, because such a number can be found in every open subinterval of $[0,1]$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  The Cantor set is nowhere dense. Recall that the \emph{Cantor set} is defined as follows. Let $I_1=[0,1]$ and let $I_2=[0,1/3]\cup[2/3,1]$ be the set $I_1$ with its open middle third removed. Inductively let $I_n$ be constructed from $I_{n-1}$ by removing the open middle third from every interval of $I_{n-1}$. Finally the Cantor set $C$ is defined to be $C=\bigcap I_n$. Then $C$ is closed because it is the intersection of closed sets. Hence to check that $C$ is nowhere dense, it suffices to show it contains no nonempty open intervals.

\ldots
\end{example}

The terminology ``nowhere dense'' may sound strange at first, but it is justified by the following fact.

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:nwd-equiv}
  Let $A$ be a set of real numbers. The following are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A$ is nowhere dense;
\item the closure of $A$ has no interior;
\item for every nonempty open set $O$, we have that $A$ is not dense in $O$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

We leave the proof as an exercise.

\begin{thm}
  The class of nowhere dense sets is closed under the operations of subset, union, and closure.  
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Preservation to subsets is immediate from the definition.

  For preservation to unions, suppose that $A,B$ are nowhere dense and let $I$ be an open interval. Since $A$ is nowhere dense, there is an open interval $J\subset I\smallsetminus A$. Since $B$ is nowhere dense there is an open interval $J_2\subset J\smallsetminus B$. It follows that
\[J_2\subset (I\smallsetminus A)\smallsetminus B=I\smallsetminus (A\cup B)
\]
This establishes that $A\cup B$ is again nowhere dense.

Preservation to closures is immediate from condition (b) of Proposition~\ref{prop:nwd-equiv}, but we can also give a direct argument. Let $A$ be nowhere dense and let $I$ be a given open interval. Since $A$ is nowhere dense there is an open interval $J$ such that $J\subset\RR\smallsetminus A$. Since $J$ is open, we also have $J\subset\RR\smallsetminus\bar{A}$. (Recall that since $\bar{A}$ is the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$, we have that $\RR\smallsetminus\bar{A}$ is the union of all open sets disjoint from $A$.) This shows that $\bar{A}$ is nowhere dense.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
  It is easy to see that the class of nowhere dense sets is \emph{not} preserved to infinite unions, even countably infinite ones.
