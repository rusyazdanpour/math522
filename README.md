## Course notes

I am writing the course notes in parallel with the lectures, so they will be updated frequently. The github page shows when the `notes.tex` file was most recently updated. You may download and compile the latest version of the source. You may also [view it online](http://latex.aslushnikov.com/compile?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fscoskey%2Fmath522%2Fmaster%2Fnotes.tex) using a free online compiler, as long as it is working.

Feedback on the notes in very welcome!

A significant part of the course notes will be drawn from Erik Holmes' senior thesis on this subject.

## Syllabus

The source of the syllabus is also available here. Again, you may download and compile or [view it online](http://latex.aslushnikov.com/compile?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fscoskey%2Fmath522%2Fmaster%2Fsyll.tex).
