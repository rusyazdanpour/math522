## Course notes

I am writing the course notes as we go along, so they are frequently being updated. You can download and compile the tex source of the latest version, or [view it online](http://latex.aslushnikov.com/compile?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fscoskey%2Fmath522%2Fmaster%2Fnotes.tex) (so long as the online viewer is working).

## Syllabus

The same goes for the syllabus, which you can [view online](http://latex.aslushnikov.com/compile?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fscoskey%2Fmath522%2Fmaster%2Fsyll.tex) as well.
